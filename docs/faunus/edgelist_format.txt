There are two standard types of serialized graph representations: adjacency list and edge list. The adjacency list is the standard Faunus format --- a  vertex and all of its incident edges. An edge list, on the other hand, is simply a list of all the edges. The edge list format does not support element properties. The format is `outVertexId\tinVertexId\tedgeLabel\n`.

The _Graph of the Gods_ data set, when represented as an edge list, looks as as follows.
