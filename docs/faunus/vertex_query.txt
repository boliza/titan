Vertex Query Graph Filters
--------------------------

// [[images/vertex-query-filter.png|width=365px|align=left|float]]

http://blueprints.tinkerpop.com[Blueprints] maintains the notion of a `VertexQuery` (see https://github.com/tinkerpop/blueprints/wiki/Vertex-Query[details]). In Blueprints, and the graph databases that provide a native implementation (e.g. http://titan.thinkaurelius.com[Titan]), a vertex's edges can be filtered at the database level prior to being pulled into memory. If data is organized on disk in a manner that respects edge indices/sorts, then this technique can drastically reduce traversal times by intelligently limiting the search space of a traverser (e.g. http://gremlin.tinkerpop.com[Gremlin]).

In Faunus, the same `VertexQuery` construct exists. However, in the context of Faunus, it is used to filter the input graph to a subset of the full graph prior to pulling the data into Hadoop. For those graph sources that support _push down predicates_, this allows the graph source to only return the edges of the vertices that satisfy the contraints of the query. The <<hadoop-config-ref,configuration>> that specifies the vertex query constraint is `vertex-query-filter`. A few examples are itemized below.

* Only vertices and their properties (no edges): `v.query().limit(0)`
* Only edges with a weight greater than 0.5: `v.query().has('weight',Compare.GREATER_THAN,0.5)`
* Only edges with label `knows`: `v.query().labels('knows')`
* Only outgoing edges: `v.query().direction(OUT)`
* Combinations of the above as specified by the `VertexQuery` API.

For those graph sources that do not support database level filtering, Faunus will process the vertex (dropping edges as specified by the `VertexQuery`) before inserting them into the `<NullWritable,FaunusVertex>` Faunus stream.
