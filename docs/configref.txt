This table is automatically generated by traversing the keys and
namespaces in Titan's internal configuration management API.

Note on Mutability Levels
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Each configuration option has a certain mutability level that governs
whether and how it can be modified after the database is opened for
the first time.  The following listing describes the mutability
levels.

FIXED::
Once the database has been opened, these configuration options cannot
be changed for the entire life of the database
GLOBAL_OFFLINE::
These options can only be changed for the entire database cluster at
once when all instances are shut down
GLOBAL::
These options can only be changed globally across the entire database
cluster
MASKABLE::
These options are global but can be overwritten by a local
configuration file
LOCAL::
These options can only be provided through a local configuration file
